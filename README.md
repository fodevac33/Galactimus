### Description

A deep space 4x game created by myself for myself. Creating the game I want to play. Focused on bringing the real complexity of economic / political systems into galactic diplomacy. No clear vision for now.

Mostly made as a side project to learn C / gamedev. Will provide releases when I have an MVP.
